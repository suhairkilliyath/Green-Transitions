            <h3>Green Transitions India</h3>
            <p>This tool shows how Indiaâ€™s ambitious green energy plans as they translate into major investments and projects across the country.India is a forerunner in the production of energy from renewable sources. As of 2020, 38% of India's electricity generation capacity has been produced from renewable sources (136 GW out of 373 GW).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Renewable projects are land-intensive, solar, hydro and wind plants all require vast areas to set up energy generating systems.Land acquisitions for solar and wind farms in multiple states have led to conflicts and protests. Local people are concerned over the lack of compensation, forceful land acquisition and loss of livelihoods.</p>
