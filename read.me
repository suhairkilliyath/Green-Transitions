## Welcome to Green Energy and Conflicts India

India has ambitious plans for transitioning into a gree energy future. This tool will track all the green energy projects in India either in the public sector or private sector across states. The tool will show spatial distribution of projects across the country, investments made or propsed, production capacity, company information, and any conflicts or litigations around the projects. 

All the data will be publicly sourced and made available on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/suhairkilliyath/) to enable free and transparent access.

Please contact [Github/suhairkilliyath] if you want to collaborate
